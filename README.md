# sortinganalyser
This is a bubble sort sorting analyser that I have created

This uses three classes: Analyser,Frame and Sorting Panel.

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. 

The time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2).
